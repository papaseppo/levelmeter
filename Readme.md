This repository contains a collection of svg graphics that can be used to etch scales into containers like fermeters or pots to be able
to easily identify how much liquid they contain. This is very useful for e.g. homebrewing. Also there is a small helper tool to create
scales for containers of different sizes.

## üìè Scales Database
The already generated or created scales can be found under the [scales/svgs](./scales/svgs) subfolder. Or for easier access use the website mentioned below:

## üåç Website
This repo also contains a jekyll website where you can find a list of available scales that is easier to look through than the svg files. 
Also you'll find instructions on how to create new scales and how they can typically be applied.

The website is hosted via github pages and can be reached here: [https://papauorg.github.io/levelmeter](http://papauorg.github.io/repository)

## ü§ñ Dotnet tool levelmeter
Scales can be created by writing definition files and then running the small tool. It will create an svg file with the scale. See the [documentation](https://papauorg.github.io/levelmeter/create) for more detailed instructions.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Contribute
